## Installation

We use VS Code for development. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The reason we recommend VS Code is so that we can provide a ready-made development environment.

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the repository with VS Code
3. When prompted, open the repository in the development container (which will set up the development environment for you)
