# Project Charter
# Project Title

Textbook Companion System Development

# Project Purpose and Justification

The purpose of this project is to develop a textbook companion system that enables fast and efficient information retrieval, provides context based responses tailored to user needs, enhances student engagement and understanding, supports personalized learning experiences, improves accessibility to textbook content, and facilitates seamless integration with existing educational tools. This system aims to streamline the user experience, making learning more interactive and accessible.

# Project Description and Scope

This project will involve the design, development, testing, and deployment of the textbook companion system. Key features include advanced search functionality, context aware responses, personalized learning paths, accessibility enhancements, and integration capabilities with existing educational platforms.

The project scope includes user research, interface design, system architecture, content integration, and pilot testing. Maintenance and support are outside the initial scope but will be considered and planned for future phases.

# Objectives and Success Criteria

As with any product, there has to be ways to measure success, hence why the under listed have been carefully selected as the success criterion for this project:

- Enable fast and efficient information retrieval with an average response time of under 2 seconds.
- Provide context based responses with a user satisfaction rate of 90% or higher, assessed through user feedback surveys.
- Enhance student engagement and understanding, reflected by a 20% improvement in learning outcomes, measured through pre and post implementation assessments.
- Support personalized learning experiences with adaptive content delivery.
- Improve accessibility with features that meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- Achieve seamless integration with open source educational tools such as OpenStax

# Tools

Considering various available tools, we have decided to utilize the following for development:

- Wagtail: Frontend development and content management.

Wagtail is a content management system platform which makes it ideal for this project given the similarities between how the product is to function and the primary design for wagtail.

- Langflow: Backend development.
- OpenStax: Content source.

NB: openstax is an educational content platform with books and resources covering a wide range of topics, hence why we have opted to utilize it as our source in this initial phase, further versions of the product will be expanded to accommodate several other sources.

# Project Team

# Workflow Design

Agile project management techniques will be adopted to run every aspect of this project. The project will be broken into small tasks, each to be included in the project backlog. A two-week sprint cycle will be adopted to ensure developers have enough time to collaborate and complete their tasks.

Standup Meetings: 15 minute standup meetings will be held at 7pm on Wednesdays.

Physical Meetups: Scheduled for Sundays to discuss progress and address any blockers.
