# Textbook Companion

A large language model textbook companion.

## Overview

This project will allow students to chat with a large language model to help them understand the content of a textbook. The model will be able to answer questions about the textbook, provide summaries of the textbook, and generate questions about the textbook.

Teachers can use the model for lesson planning, to generate quizzes, and to provide additional resources to students.

Parents can use the model to help their children with homework and to provide additional resources to their children.
